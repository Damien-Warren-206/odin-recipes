        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the strawberries</strong>
                <p>In a bowl, combine chopped strawberries with 1/4 cup of the sugar and lemon juice. Let sit for 15-20 minutes to macerate &lpar;soften and release juices&rpar;.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Blend the berries</strong>
                <p>Mash with a fork or blend lightly &lpar;for a smoother texture&rpar;. Set aside.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Mix the base</strong>
                <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the remaining sugar, heavy cream, milk, vanilla extract, and salt until the sugar is dissolved.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Combine</strong>
                <p>Stir in the prepared strawberry mixture. Taste and adjust sweetness if needed.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Chill the mixture</strong>
                <p>over and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until the mixture is very cold &lpar;overnight is ideal&rpar;.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Churn the ice cream</strong>
                <p>Pour the chilled mixture into your ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions &lpar;usually 20-25 minutes&rpar; until it reaches a soft-serve consistency.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Freeze until firm</strong>
                <p>Transfer the churned ice cream into a lidded container and freeze for 4-6 hours &lpar;or until scoopable&rpar;.</p></li>
