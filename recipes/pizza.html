        <h2> Delicious pepperoni pizza</h2>
        <p>Pepperoni pizza is a classic favorite that never fails to satisfy with its bold, savory flavor and 
           irresistible aroma. The crispy, golden crust provides the perfect base for a rich layer of tangy tomato 
           sauce, gooey melted mozzarella cheese, and generous slices of spicy, smoky pepperoni. As it bakes, the 
           pepperoni curls and crisps around the edges, releasing its oils into the cheese and creating a mouthwatering 
           combination of textures and tastes. Whether enjoyed fresh from the oven or as leftovers, pepperoni pizza 
           delivers a comforting and delicious experience in every bite.</p>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the dough</strong> 
                    <p>If making from scratch: Mix warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy. Add flour, salt, and olive oil. Knead into a smooth dough. Cover and let it rise for 1 hour.
                    &lpar;Skip this step if using ready-made dough.&rpar;</p></li>
                <li><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> 
                    <p>Set your oven to 475&deg;F &lpar;245&deg;C&rpar; and place a baking sheet or pizza stone inside to heat up.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Roll out the dough</strong>
                    <p>On a floured surface, roll the dough into a 12-14 inch circle &lpar;or any shape you like&rpar;. Transfer it to a piece of parchment paper for easy handling.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Add sauce</strong>
                    <p>Spread a thin, even layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Add cheese and toppings</strong>
                    <p>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella generously over the sauce. Add pepperoni slices on top, evenly spaced. Optionally, add herbs or Parmesan.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Bake the pizza</strong>
                    <p>Slide the pizza &lpar;on the parchment&rpar; onto the preheated baking sheet or stone. Bake for 10-14 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Cool and serve</strong>
                    <p>Let the pizza cool for a couple of minutes, then slice and enjoy your hot, crispy pepperoni pizza!</p></li>
